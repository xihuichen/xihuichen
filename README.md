### Welcome to my snapshot of off-work time ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automation in Fund Risk Management industry
  However, due to contract confidentiality reasons, the scripts I created at work belongs to my employer, so wouldn't be uploaded here. If you want to know this side of me, navigate down to RiskAnalytics-Tool and re-striking option those two python repositories, they were created six years ago when I worked for an investment bank developing counterparty credit risk exposure calculation, I also developed NLP tool to categorize different trade requests but it's still in use so would be a breach if I uploaded here.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development through ATU part time post graduate certificate
  The repositories using Java are the projects I worked on through my course, expected to have more repositories focusing on unit test, agile software development, web application development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about financial mathematics and its application in real world risk management, algorithm design and data analytics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: xihui.chen@foxmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: My resiliency and positive curiosity drove me to Amazon jungle in Peru -- watched birdies there and took some amazing photos, achieved my childhood dream
